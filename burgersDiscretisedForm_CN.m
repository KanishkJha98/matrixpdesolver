function [FU] = burgersDiscretisedForm_CN(U,Uold,CH,CV,DH,DV,dt)

% Store the discretised form of the Burgers' equation as a nonlinear matrix
% equations, for the Crank-Nicolson scheme. The boundary values are set to 
% 0 after we use them in the equation, as we do not necessarily need the 
% data at the boundary nodes for any form of computation. They exist merely 
% to ensure that the dimensions of the coefficient matrices conform.
% function [FU] = burgersDiscretisedForm_CN(U,Uold,CH,CV,DH,DV,dt)
% Input: U - The matrix containing the unknown variables at every node
%            point
%        Uold - The matrix containing the (known) values of U at current
%        time step
%        CH - The horizontal convective matrix corresponding to
%             discretisation of convective term in y-direction
%        CV - The vertical convective matrix corresponding to
%             discretisation of convective term in x-direction
%        DH - The horizontal diffusion matrix corresponding to
%             discretisation of the diffusive term in y-direction
%        DV - The vertical diffusion matrix corresponding to discretisation
%             of the diffusive term in x-direction
%        dt - The incremental time step value
% Output: FU - The equation matrix that represents the discretised form of
%              the Burgers' equation for each internal node, and has 0 at
%              each boundary node.
